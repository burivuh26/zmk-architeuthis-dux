# ZMK config for Architeuthis Dux

**Notice**: Architeuthis Dux is now supported by default in ZMK as **this shield has been [merged][9] into ZMK** `main`! ðŸŽ‰ 

You should no longer use this repository. Instead, select `A. Dux` from the ZMK installer or use the upstream [`a_dux`][10] shield. ðŸ™‚

## What is this?

[ZMK keyboard firmware][1] configuration for [Architeuthis Dux by Tapi][2].

![Wireless Architeuthis Dux with nice!nano controllers][3]

The [`architeuthis_dux` shield in this repository](/config/boards/shields/architeuthis_dux/) is an adaptation of the direct pin [Cradio shield by @davidphilipbarr][4].

## How do I use this firmware?

Ready-to-flash firmware files for many MCU boards can be downloaded from the latest build on the GitHub "[Actions][8]" tab.

A very simple QWERTY keymap is provided which is useful for ensuring a new keyboard is functional. To make your own customisations to the keymap, simply [fork this repo][7] and modify [`config/architeuthis_dux.keymap`](config/architeuthis_dux.keymap); GitHub will then build your ready-to-flash firmware in the GitHub "Actions" tab of your own repo.

Please refer to the [ZMK docs][5] if necessary (the [troubleshooting section][6] can be particularly helpful).
